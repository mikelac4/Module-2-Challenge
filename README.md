# Module-2-Challenge Portfolio

## Description
This webpage was created to use as a portfolio for my work. The page is broken down into 3 sections with a header at the top. In the header I have a profile picture, my name and links for the 3 sections through the page. The first section is an about me page for future employers to get to know me. The second section displays with some of my previous work. A link attached to each image in to this second to each application the image portrays. The third section holds my contact information. I used different flex elements throughout the page to style my page and added a media query to adjust the page based on various screens and devices.
