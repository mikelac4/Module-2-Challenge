            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p> I am an aspiring web developer that has a deep passion for my work. This passion stems from being able to create a vison for how I want a project to look like and function a certain way 
                and watching how that vision comes to life as I go through the process of structuring and styling a web page from start to finish. I have a great work ethic and will do whatever it takes 
                to meet any deadlines that are set. I am a team player and have great communication skills. I believe these are important characteristics to have as a web developer because it enables
                you to work alongside your peers and work with the client to create exactly what their looking for.
